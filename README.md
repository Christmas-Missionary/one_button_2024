# What is this?

This is a game I made for the [1-Button Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2024).  
You can find the game [here](https://christmas-missionary.itch.io/ball-game).

Those assets specified belong to other copyright holders with their own licenses.  
`GODOT_ENGINE` and `GODOT_3RD_PARTY` are there to fulfill all licenses from the Godot Engine and components used.  
Unfortunately, due to the minimalist nature of this jam, I have not been able to include the licenses in-game, but there links on the itch.io page, or you can navigate to `other_copyrights`.
