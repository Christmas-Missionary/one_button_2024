# What is this?

This is a game I made for the [1-Button Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2024).  
You can find the game [here](https://christmas-missionary.itch.io/ball-game).

The 0BSD license applies to all source code, and the [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en) license applies to all assets, unless a file is specified in `this_project.txt`.  
Those assets specified belong to other copyright holders with their own licenses or are derivative works by me.  
`GODOT_ENGINE` and `GODOT_3RD_PARTY` are there to fulfill all licenses from the Godot Engine and components used.  
Unfortunately, due to the minimalist nature of this game, I have not been able to include the licenses in-game, but all legal stuff should be printed in the web console (Cmd+Opt+k for Mac). Make sure it is open before starting the game.
There are also links on the itch.io page to the github repo, where you can navigate to `other_copyrights`.
